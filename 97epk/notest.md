#97 Things Every Prorgammer Should Know

Reading notes from the **97 Things Every Programmer Should know** 

## Act with Prudence
1. Pressure is inevitable irrespective of the schedule (Relaxed or Tight)
2. Choose "Do it right" instead of "Do it quick"
3. Avoid **Technical Debt**
4. Short cut in the code make scalable and refactoring hard
5. Don't wait, fix issues early
6. Fix the root cause, not the symptom
7. If technical debot is taken, pay it back quickly 
8. Pay off technical debit as soon as possible. It would be imprudent to do otherwise

## Apply Functional Programming Principles
1. Master Functional Programming paradigm (Improves code quality)
2. Functional paradigm exhibits higher degree of referential transparency
3. Referential transparency - Imples functions consistently yield same results for the same input, irrespective of where and when they are invoked
4. Leading cause of defects in imperative code is attributable to mutable variables
5. Visibility semantics can help to mitigate mutable variables


## Ask, "What Would the User Do?"(You Are Not the User)
1. People don't think like programmers (False consensus bias)
2. Watch users in action, ask them to use the software
3. Don't give specific instructions to users, when they are testing
4. When debugging, follow the same steps as done by the user

## Somewhare Today, a Project is Failing
* The major problems of our work are not so much technological as sociological in nature
* Most of failures are cited as _Politics_, but under it has communicatio problems, staffing problems, disenchantment with the boss or with the client, lack of motivation, and high turnover
* The main reason we tend to focus on the technical rather than the human side of the work is not because it’s more crucial, but because it’s easier to do
* The “make a cheeseburger, sell a cheeseburger” mentality can be fatal in your development area. It can only serve to damp your people’s spirits and focus their attention away from the real problems at hand
